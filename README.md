# GuessTheNumber
Guess the Number: The computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts.

Here's an example of how you can integrate the "Guess the Number" game with FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python:

First, make sure you have FastAPI and uvicorn (ASGI server) installed:

Next, create a file named main.py with the following code:

To run the FastAPI server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Now, you can access the game API at http://localhost:8000:

Visit http://localhost:8000/ to see a welcome message.
Make a POST request to http://localhost:8000/guess/{user_guess} with your guess as the user_guess parameter. For example, to guess the number 42, make a POST request to http://localhost:8000/guess/42.
Please note that this is a basic example, and you can enhance the API and game logic further as per your requirements.

Place your main.py and requirements.txt files in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing these files.

Build the Docker image:
docker build -t guess-the-number .

The -t flag assigns a tag (name) to the image. In this case, we're using guess-the-number.

Run the Docker container:

docker run -d -p 8000:8000 guess-the-number
The -d flag runs the container in detached mode, and the -p flag maps the host port 8000 to the container port 8000.

Now you should be able to access your FastAPI-based "Guess the Number" game by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000. You can stop the container by using docker stop <container_id> where <container_id> is the ID of the running container. You can find the container ID by running docker ps.
