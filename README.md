# GuessTheNumber
Guess the Number: The computer generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts.

Here's an example of how you can integrate the "Guess the Number" game with FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python:

First, make sure you have FastAPI and uvicorn (ASGI server) installed:

Next, create a file named main.py with the following code:

To run the FastAPI server:
uvicorn main:app --reload

Now, you can access the game API at http://localhost:8000:

Visit http://localhost:8000/ to see a welcome message.
Make a POST request to http://localhost:8000/guess/{user_guess} with your guess as the user_guess parameter. For example, to guess the number 42, make a POST request to http://localhost:8000/guess/42.
Please note that this is a basic example, and you can enhance the API and game logic further as per your requirements.
